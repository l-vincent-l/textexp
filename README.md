# Textexp

To start your Phoenix server:

* Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
* Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://phoenix.hexdocs.pm/deployment.html).

## Deployment

Two deployments run the same code, to compare them. Both are started by hand.

| | Fly.io | Bunny |
|---|---|---|
| Application | one machine, suspended when idle (`fly.toml`) | Magic Container `textexp` |
| Database | SQLite file on a volume | Bunny Database, through `ecto_hrana` |
| Backup | Litestream, to Tigris | Bunny's |
| Image | `fly` target, built by Fly | `final` target with `DATABASE_ADAPTER=hrana`, on ghcr.io |
| Deploy | `fly deploy` | Actions > Bunny image > Run workflow, then deploy the image on Bunny |
| URL | https://textexp.fly.dev | https://mc-3gejc6ktt2.bunny.run |

The database is chosen at compile time by `DATABASE_ADAPTER` (`sqlite3`, the
default, or `hrana`), see `config/config.exs`. On Bunny, the container reads
`BUNNY_DATABASE_URL` and `BUNNY_DATABASE_AUTH_TOKEN`; its image is built and
pushed to ghcr.io by `.github/workflows/bunny-image.yml`.

To compare them, each `/admin/dashboard` shows the query times measured by
the server (page Metrics, `textexp.sqlite_repo.query`), once `DASHBOARD_USER`
and `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` are set.

Locally, against a libSQL server:

    export DATABASE_ADAPTER=hrana BUNNY_DATABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080
    mix compile --force   # the adapter is compiled in
    mix phx.server
